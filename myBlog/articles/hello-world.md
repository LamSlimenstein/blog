# Hello World !

Hi there, this is my first article. So gonna keep it simple and precise. I am from India doing undergrad in Information Technology. I am an aspiring programmer. Know some stuff about Web Development, Open-Sources and Algorithms. Life has been teaching me some pretty hard lessons. Changing my pass-time stuff to gain some knowledge and gonna keep a check about myself and about my workflow. I promised myself to do well in college and work harder than ever. I am gonna write about those sometimes occasionally.
